TO DO:
* Learn more about React stuff (hooks, useState, useEffect... etc... when to use and whatnot )
* Debouncing --> any time a letter is typed, some things happen (console logs going crazy)
* Reload page after session or athlete has been created or deleted
* In controller: push errors. Then in frontend: use and display errors when appropriate

<!-- For Data Analysis: -->

<!-- Login Page -->
* Create Forgot Password option. sends you email with your password 

<!-- Create Account Page -->


<!-- Athletes + Sessions -->
* More info/filter options for athletes
* Autofill searches via a filter?
* Create athletesFilter component
* make searches not case sensitive 

<!-- Sessions -->

<!-- Coach Dashboard -->
* For Create Athlete section:
    * Make birthday MM-DD-YYYY format ?

<!-- Athletes' Dashboard -->

<!-- Other: -->
* Upgrade routes to be separated by auth, athletes, sessions, users, etc... 
* Containerize via Docker (or similar)
* Make errors show up on display for necessary pages (ex: pages where data is filled in)
* Redirect to login/create account/dashboard pages where applicable (after logging in/creating an account, etc) -> in controller.js
* Reduce repetetive code by using React 
    * useEffect calls for getting sessions for coach vs athlete dashboards?

<!-- To Create: Individual Athlete Pages -->
* Ensure that athletes/parents can only access their specific pages 

<!-- To Create: Individual Sessions Pages -->

<!-- To Create: Team Page -->
* Can see average stats for a team or all athletes associated with a team and specific age categories 

<!-- To Create: Parents' Dashboard -->

<!-- Google OAuth -->
* How to add "status" when signing up/logging into an account with Google
* How to separate Google OAuth names in database by first/last since it is just "name"? 
* Google OAuth 'in practice' functionality
    * Login page --> have option for google login underneath and if created user matches email of existing google login (or vice versa) then merge the accounts/rows in the database!
